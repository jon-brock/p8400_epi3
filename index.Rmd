### Course Description  

This is the third epidemiology course in the sequence of methods courses. The course focuses on integrating study design methods with advanced statistical analyses. Lectures cover theoretical concepts, including confounding, interaction, and pseudo risks and rates, and several analytical methods including linear, logistic, Cox Proportional Hazards, and Poisson regression methods. The course will also touch briefly on other generalized linear models (e.g. relative risk regression) and methods for handling
correlated data (GEE, multi-level modeling). Computer laboratories make use of multiple datasets to provide students with an opportunity to implement the analytical methods covered in lecture. Multivariable methods to test for confounding, interaction, and mediation are taught both in lecture and laboratories. The goal of this course is to provide both theoretical and practical experience in analyzing and interpreting epidemiological data.

### Course Learning Objectives  

Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:  
1. Compare and differentiate the strengths and limitations of the different study designs in epidemiology  
2. Examine and quantify the role of information bias, selection bias, and confounding in the estimation of measures of association  
3. Evaluate and quantify the role of interaction on both an additive and multiplicative scale and the implications of scale on estimation  
4. Apply multivariable regression methods commonly used in epidemiology and understand the assumptions of these regression methods compared to categorical methods  
5. Assess confounding, interaction and mediation using multivariable models

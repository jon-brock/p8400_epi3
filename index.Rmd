### Course Description  

This is the third epidemiology course in the sequence of methods courses. The course focuses on integrating study design methods with advanced statistical analyses. Lectures cover theoretical concepts, including confounding, interaction, and pseudo risks and rates, and several analytical methods including linear, logistic, Cox Proportional Hazards, and Poisson regression methods. The course will also touch briefly on other generalized linear models (e.g. relative risk regression) and methods for handling
correlated data (GEE, multi-level modeling). Computer laboratories make use of multiple datasets to provide students with an opportunity to implement the analytical methods covered in lecture. Multivariable methods to test for confounding, interaction, and mediation are taught both in lecture and laboratories. The goal of this course is to provide both theoretical and practical experience in analyzing and interpreting epidemiological data.  

***  

### Course Learning Objectives  

Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:  
1. Compare and differentiate the strengths and limitations of the different study designs in epidemiology  
2. Examine and quantify the role of information bias, selection bias, and confounding in the estimation of measures of association  
3. Evaluate and quantify the role of interaction on both an additive and multiplicative scale and the implications of scale on estimation  
4. Apply multivariable regression methods commonly used in epidemiology and understand the assumptions of these regression methods compared to categorical methods  
5. Assess confounding, interaction and mediation using multivariable models

### Audience Response Software  

We will be using audience response questions during lecture to encourage participation and to give students an opportunity to participate during lecture. You will receive points for participating and for answering polls correctly. Your responses will count toward 5% of your grade. You will need to register with Poll Everywhere using your Columbia UNI and password. Your Poll Everywhere account will be linked to your Courseworks gradebook, therefore, your account must be associated with your Columbia email.  

If you already have a Poll Everywhere account, verify that it is associated with one of your Columbia email addresses. If you have an account linked to a non-Columbia email (i.e., Gmail, yahoo, Hotmail, etc.), you will need to create a new account. A document will be shared before the first class and poste to Courseworks (Files > Poll Everywhere) detailing the steps necessary to register for a Poll Everywhere account.  

To use Poll Everywhere, you can either download the app to your phone or table or access it through the following website: www.pollev.com/jeaninegenki547 . If you would like to use the app on your phone or tablet, please download the app before the first class.

### Assessment and Grading Policy  

Student grades will be based on:  

Course Item | Grade Weight  
--- | :---:  
Homeworks | 20%  
Pre-semester assessment | 5%  
Quizzes | 15%  
Poll Everywhere participation | 5%  
Midterm exam | 25%  
Final exam | 30%  

***  

#### Pre-Semester Assessment  

Before the start of the semester students must complete the online pre-semester assessment. It is administered through Canvas (Quizzes) and is due before **10:00 a.m.** on the first day of class. The first part of the assessment reviews epidemiologic concepts from pre-requisite Epi courses and the second part reviews concepts from SAS and Categorical Data Analysis. Review materials are posted on Canvas (Files).  

The goal of this assessment is to help the instructor and TAs tailor the course and laboratory sessions to students’ level of comfort with pre-requisite material. You will be given 1 hour to complete the assessment. The pre-semester assessment is completion based, but students must complete all of it to receive full credit. The assessment is **open book**; however, students must work **independently** to complete the assessment.

***  

#### Homework  

* Homework is due **in class** at 1:00 p.m. on Tuesdays before lecture. Please write neatly or type your answers. No credit will be given for illegible answers.  
* Late homework will **NOT** be accepted.  
* The lowest homework grade will be dropped so that each homework counts 4% of the total
homework grade.
* All students must abide by the Mailman HONOR code. 

***  

#### Quizzes  

Four quizzes (two announced, two unannounced) will be given throughout the semester in either
lecture or laboratory sessions. Announced quizzes are take-home and their due dates are listed below in the course schedule. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped so that each quiz counts 5% of the total quiz grade.

***  

#### Midterm Exam  

This exam will be given in-class on **October 15th**. It is a closed-book exam. If there is a valid reason for missing an exam, you must notify the instructor **two weeks prior** to the exam.

***  

#### Final Exam  

The final exam consists of two parts, an **in-class exam on Tuesday, December 10th** (worth 10% of the final exam grade) and a take-home (open-book) portion due Thursday, December 12th (worth 20% of the final exam grade). The take-home portion of the final exam will be distributed via Canvas at the end of day on December 3rd and will be **due in person on Thursday, December 12th at 12:00 p.m.**. The take-home portion of the exam should be submitted in person and specific submission details will be provided closer to the exam due date. The exam will cover material presented over the entire semester, but it will focus primarily on post-midterm material. The take-home portion of the exam must be turned in on time. For every day late, there will be a 5% reduction in grade.

***  

### Final Grade Cutpoints  

Percentage Range | Letter Grade  
:---: | :---:  
98.0 or above | A+  
94.0 - 97.9 | A

***  

### Re-Grading Policy  

If students have questions about their grade on any assignment (homework, quiz, exam) they must bring it to Dr. Genkinger.  

***  

### Lecture Recordings  

The class will be taped with the slides. However, this class is not designed as an online course. The taped classes will only be available on a case by case basis if you need to miss a class due to illness etc. or if you have a disability, or other need for audio reinforcement. Please contact [Richard Teran](rat2127@cumc.columbia.edu) to request regular access or to request access to the tape for a specific class.

### Mailman School Policies and Expectations  

Students and faculty have a shared commitment to the School’s [mission, values and oath](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/about/mission-history).  

#### Academic Integrity  

Students are required to adhere to the [Mailman School Honor Code](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/current-students/community-standards)  

* Homework assignments:  

    + You may discuss concepts and work through homework problems with classmates; however, the work you submit must be your own (e.g., in your own words, performing your own calculations, providing your own code and results).  

    + It is in violation of the honor code to use answer keys from previous semesters to complete course assignments. Sharing of answer keys either directly or via internet upload is strictly prohibited in this class.  
    
* Take-home quizzes:  

    + Quizzes are open book/open notes, but must be completed independently. You **cannot**
discuss the quiz or work with classmates to complete the quiz. You may only discuss the
content of the quiz with classmates after the quiz due date (i.e., after all students have completed the quiz).  

* Final exam:  

    + Unlike homework, for the final exam you **may not** discuss concepts or work through
exam questions with classmates – **you must complete the final exam alone**. If you have any clarification questions after release of the final exam you may direct them to your TA and the professor.  

Anyone found to be in violation of these course procedures will be [reported to OSA](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/current-students/office-student-affairs).
